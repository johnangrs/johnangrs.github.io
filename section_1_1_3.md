Why did you click this link? Was it some element of self-doubt? Perhaps after reading through the earlier sections, you're feeling a little overwhelmed and are casting about for a little something extra to grab onto. (Or maybe you are just conscientious and methodical and you're now scoffing at my attempts to inject some drama into this prose)

This page contains a few parting words from Paul Graham for founders embarking on their startup journey. His message - nobody should feel uncomfortable that they don't 'get' the startup process, because the whole thing is counterintuitive on so many levels:

1. Think about what your instincts were telling you as you read the chapters above. Did some of the prescribed best practices sound foreign and awkward to you? More of them will come as we delve further into this topic. 

If there is one instinct you can trust, however, it is your instinct about people (eg: don't bury any misgivings or strange feelings when talking to seemingly impressive looking 'big shots' in the industry, your instincts will probably be right)

2. Don't worry so much about being an expert in startups. More importantly, you have to be an expert in users. (This is also the reason why we can abridge CS183)

3. There are no tricks or shortcuts. You can't game the system or manipulate metrics to make money. Either a user loves your product, or they do not. It sounds obvious, but when the going gets tough, dreaming about an easy way out becomes a compelling hobby

4. Startups cannot be done with half commitment. They are all consuming of your life. 

5. No matter how many case studies you read or entrepreneurs you talk to, you won't know if you will be good at startups until you actually try it.

To summarize, as a startup founder, you have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable, making decisions with imperfect information, and feeling like you're totally out of your league a majority of the time.

That said, from all the startup founders here at AISG, we would all have done it again given the choice.

## Think you're not ready yet? Don't worry, nobody is every really ready.

This page contains a few parting words from Paul Graham for founders embarking on their startup journey. His message - nobody should feel uncomfortable that they don't 'get' the startup process, because the whole thing is counterintuitive on so many levels:

1. Think about what your instincts were telling you as you read the chapters above. Did some of the prescribed best practices sound foreign and awkward to you? More of them will come as we delve further into this topic. If there is one instinct you can trust, however, it is your instinct about people (eg: don't bury any misgivings or strange feelings when talking to seemingly impressive looking 'big shots' in the industry, your instincts will probably be right)

2. Don't worry so much about being an expert in startups. More importantly, you have to be an expert in users. 

3. There are no tricks or shortcuts. You can't game the system or manipulate metrics to make money. Either a user loves your product, or they do not. It sounds obvious, but when the going gets tough, dreaming about an easy way out becomes a compelling hobby

4. Startups cannot be done with half commitment. They are all consuming of your life. 

5. No matter how many case studies you read or entrepreneurs you talk to, you won't know if you will be good at startups until you actually try it.

To summarize, as a startup founder, you have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable, making decisions with imperfect information, and feeling like you're totally out of your league a majority of the time. But, for those who can get confortable with the startup process, the juice is worth the squeeze.

Launching a startup is a journey, and we know that for many people, startup 'lessons' only start to make sense after founders are in the middle of a problem. We have chosen to help each individual startup tackle these problems as they arise during AIAP, rather than treat them as academic exercises.

However, we cannot recommend the content in CS183b: How to Start a Startup highly enough, and many of the problems that we help startups work through during the 7 months are covered in the series. If you are interested in the breadth of issues that founders launching a startup face, watch all the videos in this series and bookmark it so that you can come back to it to review topics as they come up in your startup journey.

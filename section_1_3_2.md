## Thoughts on how to structure your focus and selling efforts

### Don't rush to scale and tackle big markets

Can you have a conversation about startups without being asked how it will scale?

Given how often this question crops up, startup founders can be forgiven for thinking what they're doing doesn't count until they start to scale. However, we believe that thinking too much about scaling before you are ready can take focus away from what really matters in the early stages of your startup. 

Consider customer service. Customer satisfaction is the lifeblood of any startup. If you attempt to scale before your are ready, will your small three man team (even if you try to hire more staff there will be a lag time in hiring and training) be able to handle the quantity of customer service requests from that many customers? Will poor customer service then result in customers leaving your product just as soon as they sign up?

Second is the question of discoverability. If you rush to scale into a big market, how will your customers be able to discover you, with all the other options that are available to them? Many hidden dangers and pitfalls lie here.

Third is the question of competition. The big boys in tech are servicing the mainstream customers in the big markets, and trying to scale into these markets will bring you into direct competition with the Googles, Facebooks and Amazons of the world. This is scary for any team, much less a three-man early stage startup. 

So, is it any wonder that [Startup Genome found 74 percent of high-growth startups fail due to premature scaling?](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/318591). 

### Why you should go after a small market

The opposite of the above, however, is true for small markets

1. Customer satisfaction is easier to obtain in a small market, because it is likely that this market has been ignored by more recent mainstream tech advances. So, even if your technology is not the latest cutting-edge tech, your customers will still walk away satisfied.

2. Word of mouth spreads faster in a small market, and you will be able to grow outsized market share much more easily than in a big market.

3. The big companies are not interested in expanding into small markets, so you are relatively safe and insulated from big competition while building out your foothold. 

### Niche down twice, then expand your foothold

So, we hope that the above has made a convincing case on why you should not rush to scale, and should focus your initial efforts on building a foothold in a smaller market.

How do you actually do it? For the purpose of planning the first few months, being able to think through a couple of guideposts will suffice.

First, practice two levels of "niche-ing down". For example, if you were launching a "dating app" service, then a Level 0 niche would be to just launch a dating app for everyone. A Level 1 niche would be to launch a "dating app for people in the creative scene". A Level 2 niche would be to launch a "dating app for people in the creative scene, focusing on the student population at local universities".

The secret sauce in this approach is that the startup must walk a very fine between a good Level 2 niche, and something that fails to achieve critical mass. The key is that this niche should be small enough to have almost no value, but has high potential to expand, and scale, horizontally afterwards

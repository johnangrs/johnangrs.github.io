## Ideation Discovery Session

Organizations and teams tend to make 3 main mistakes when identifying AI use cases

1. Groupthink - Usually, an ideation session begins as thoughts are shared informally, such as in a roundtable discussion. However, in such a setting extroverts tend to dominate discussions, and ideas may be 'pre-filtered' to meet the group's definition of a good idea.

2. Lack of understanding of where AI will fit in the business process - Most of the time, ideas generated by a data science team or from management fail to take into account how the inputs and outputs from the AI algorithm will fit into the business process. This can cause resistance to adoption, or worse, render the AI algorithm useless.

3. No confirmation of data availability or granularity - Many business and management teams begin ideating AI use cases before checking data availability or granularity, which usually lies with the IT team. More often than not, the IT team will inform the business units that they have not been saving the data, or that the wrong data is being saved for the purpose of the AI use case.

In order to avoid these mistakes, we have adapted the Design Sprint from Google Ventures. [SHOW PICTURES AND GIVE LINK SUPERSCRIPT]. The design sprint has proven to be a great structured process for solving problems and testing new ideas, and it has been adopted by organizations worldwide, from Red Hat to Accenture. 

In a standard design sprint, we map, storyboard and prototype over the course of 5 days. For the AI Ideation discovery, we only focus on the *mapping* portion, which is why we can slim it down to 1.5 hours.

The remainder of the design sprint is mapped to the AI Prioritization session and AI Solution Modelling, which we will go through individually with you if your idea makes it past the selection stage.

## What will happen during the 1.5 hours?
1. Each participant will take turns to share their challenges and ideas in the context of the industry. (Picture below shows how we do it in a corporate setting for reference)

2. The facilitator will group the ideas into categories.

3. Participants will vote on what they think are the top 2 ideas presented.

4. Ideas that have less than two votes will be removed (this does not mean they are bad!).

5. The facilitator will guide all participants in a white space exploration and goal definition for the top voted ideas.

6. At the end of the session, we encourage teams to form around the idea owner. NOTE: There can only be one team per idea, and idea owner chooses his final 1-2 teammates. If you are lucky enough to have a very popular idea, this will be your first management test ;)

7. If your idea was not chosen but you are still very keen on developing it, come talk to us and we can discuss how to further explore the white space with you

## Don't let the word "enterprise grade" scare you. Building for the enterprise could be a fantastic strategy

In this section, we make the case that while many of us tend to think of startups as B2C endeavors, the default sales setting of a software startup's product should be B2B. Consider some of the top names in tech today:

- Facebook, Microsoft and Google all primarily make revenues by servicing businesses. 

- Uber started out as an app for corporate ride hailing (black cars in New York City). 

- AirB&B got their start by offering rooms in bulk for attendees to political conventions. 

- WeWork (terrible business plan aside), also made revenues from servicing businesses.

Why is this the case? We expand on two of the main reasons below, namely that 1) enterprises are generally willing to pay at higher rates than customers, and 2) the the market for enterprise software is bigger than that of consumer software

### Enterprises are generally willing to pay at the higher rate than customers

If you look at corporate cell phone plans versus consumer cell phone plans, you will find that for the same price, the consumer gets more than 10x the data and talktime than enterprises. 

There are many reasons for this phenomenon, but one of the primary reasons is the requirements that enterprises have for their products to work (in terms of uptime, features, customer support, sophistication, etc..) are higher than that for consumers, and consequently, they have higher budgets as well. A enterprise product also needs to grow with their customers. 

On the other hand, a consumer is primarily concerned about getting the lowest price just for the feature set that they want. 

Combined together, this makes enterprises much more willing to pay higher prices than consumers for products that solve their problems.

### The market for enterprise software is bigger than that of consumer software

Also, have a think about the software systems that you use in your daily, personal life. They probably do not number more than a handful.

In order to service their customers and make money, enterprises need to execute a far greater range of activity than a regular consumer. Thus, as a business user, you probably interact with a far greater number of business software systems in the course of your daily work. This makes the market for enterprise software larger than that of solely consumer facing software. 

### How to create for the enterprise as a startup?

It is actually not difficult for a startup to service the enterprise market. Consider the image below:

Over time, customers will demand better technology. But vendors of technology generally tend to improve their technology much faster to service their most demanding customers or to chase a higher profit margin market.

Eventually, the different pace of technology improvement means that the mainstream product becomes too expensive for companies that are lower down on the technology requirement hierarchy. This opens a window of opportunity for startup companies, to come in and offer more suitable products to this niche market. 

### The choice between creating for consumers and creating for enterprises is a false one

Finally, it is important to understand that there really is no difference in creating software for the enterprise and creating for consumers because at the end of the day, humans will be the ones using your software!

As long as the software is aimed at anticipating and solving the problems of the human user, the DNA of the software mirrors that of the consumer, and that actually lets you open two sales channels to the companies - the procurement department and the users themselves.

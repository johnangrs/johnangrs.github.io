### 4 key ingredients for startup success

To build a great company, there are 4 essential ingredients that a startup absolutely must have. They are

1. Fantastic idea
2. Fantastic product
3. Fantastic team
4. Fantastic execution

We will cover just the first one on the list in the first six weeks. Without a fantastic idea as the foundation, energy spent on the rest of the items will be tragically wasted.

We will also touch on finding a good co-founder, which is a sub element of building a fantastic team.

If you get through the selection process, we will begin working with you on the rest of the items over the next 7 months.

Good luck and all the best!

## 4 key ingredients for startup success
  
To build a great company, there are 4 essential ingredients that a startup absolutely must have. They are

1. Fantastic idea
2. Fantastic product
3. Fantastic team
4. Fantastic execution

The content in this companion guide will cover just the first one on the list in the first ten weeks. Without a fantastic idea as the foundation, energy spent on the rest of the items will be sadly wasted.

When you register your interest with us, we will begin the process of helping you find a good co-founder, which is a sub element of building a fantastic team.

Finally, when you get through the selection process, we will begin working with you on building fantastic products and executing well over the next 7 months.

Good luck, and we look forward to having you on the startup track!

### Why is the AIAP Startup Program a great place to launch an AI startup?

The AIAP Startup Program is designed as a "low risk, high support" program. In addition to the AIAP stipend, which every AIAP participant gets, AISG compute resources, data scientists, AI engineers and industry mentors will be made available in service of your idea as part of the support mechanism provided.   

### How similar/different is this program to other accelerator programs in Singapore?

Most accelerator programs are profit / valuation driven. The AISG Startup Program focuses on building sustainable businesses that make a difference in our lives and create jobs for Singaporeans.

Most accelerator programs leave you to solve your own technical problems. The AISG Startup Program assigns your project multiple technical experts to help you develop the best product. 

### What is CS183b? Should I go through all of it?

CS183b is a course on "How to launch a startup" conducted by Sam Altman of Y Combinator. It was the follow-on course to CS183 which was taught by Peter Thiel (and resulted in the book "Zero to One").

If you want to experience CS183 by Peter Thiel, you can get the book "Zero to One" for free at our local library.

However, the author's opinion is that CS183b is superior because it brings together a diversity of voices from within the venture capital industry to talk about the topic that they are best at.

If you are super passionate about startups, you should absolutely go through all of CS183b, and read Zero to One while you are at it too.

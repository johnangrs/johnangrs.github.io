## The very first thing
  
What is a fantastic idea? How do you know one when you see it?

You may be thinking that the initial idea of a startup doesn't matter much, after all, isn't it common advice to "just start", then "fail fast" and pivot even faster?

The advice above is not wrong, but none of them should actually be taken to mean that you should start without a good idea. Sam Altman puts it best when he says "A bad idea is still bad... and great execution towards a terrible idea will get you nowhere." 

Your mentors agree wholeheartedly. It is far more preferable to pivot around a good idea than to try to squeeze your way out of a bad one. 

So. You need an idea. What should an idea consist of?

1. It should be able to be articulated in 1-2 sentences

2. It should have a sense of the size and growth of the market

3. It should have a sense of the growth strategy of the company

4. It should have a sense of how defensible the business idea is

5. It should understand where it wants to be in 10 years

Other than that, that's it! Your AISG mentors know that even the best ideas can sounds outlandish at the outset, and we specifically look for ideas that generate strong opinions on both ends, so don't feel afraid to test your ideas with us.

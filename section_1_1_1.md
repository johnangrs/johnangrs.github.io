### The very first thing\

What is a fantastic idea? How do you know one when you see it?

You may be thinking that the initial idea of a startup doesn't matter much, after all, doesn't the sage advice go "just start", then "fail fast" and pivot even faster?

The advice above is not wrong, but none of them should actually be taken to mean that you should start without a good idea. Sam Altman puts it best when he says "A bad idea is still bad... and great execution towards a terrible idea will get you nowhere." 

We agree wholeheartedly. It is far more preferable to pivot around a good idea than to try to squeeze your way out of a bad one. 

So. You need an idea. What should an idea consist of?

1. It should be able to be articulated in 1-2 sentences

2. It should have a sense of the size and growth of the market

3. It should have a sense of the growth strategy of the company

4. It should have a sense of how defensible the business idea is

5. It should understand where it wants to be in 10 years

### Passing the sniff test

There one key insight that most first-time founders miss when then coming up with their idea:

**A fantastic idea must seem like a bad idea to some people**. 

If it sounds like a great idea to everyone, then too many of the smartest people will be working on them, and you don't want that competition. 

Consider that Google was the 13th search engine in line (with no portal), and that Facebook was the 10th social network (and only limited to US college students), and that AirB&B was an alternative to couch surfing, except that you had to pay, and that Carousell is essentially a jazzed up Craigslist... the list goes on and on

So your idea passes the sniff test if people tell you its a bad idea, but in your **heart** you can explain why it is a good one a thousand times over (this also signals the depth of your passion for the subject, which is also very important, but more on that later). Unpopular with the masses but right for a subset of people is what you are going for. Imagine what Google's, Facebook, AirB&B and Carousell v0.1 pitch must have sounded like - you want something that sounds like a bad idea, but is a good idea.

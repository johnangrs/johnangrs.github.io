## Best practices for building a product and talking to users

The majority of the content in this section is covered by Adora Cheung in her 
[CS183 lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP176MBG9Tk&list=PLU630Cd0ZQCMeQiSvU7DJmDJDitdE7m7r&index=5&t=0s)

### Pre-flight check 

By now, you should have read through the [Foundations](https://johnangrs.github.io/section_1_1.html) section, and gone through the Ideation Discovery session. One of the elements that you might have noticed recurring throughout these sections is the idea that the problem which you have decided to solve must resonate strongly with you. This part is so - super - very - important - that we will repeat it again here.

**Do only something that you are passionate about. Solve problems that affect
you personally or ones that have made an impact on you after you witnessed them.**

This element is core to surmounting many of the challenges you will face on this
journey, both internal and external. If this core is not strong, it will cause a
lot of headaches down the road. 

### Step 1 - What does your product do?

OK. You have a problem that you are passionate about and want to solve. Now, we
need to be able to describe what your product does... in one sentence. Yes. One. At this moment,
you probably are able to describe your solution or product in two to three sentences.
To get it down to one sentence it hard, but it is essential if you want your customers,
investors and partners to pass your product on by word of mouth. Here are some one
sentence descriptions actually used by founders of companies. Can you identify which companies they are referring to?

*Type someone's name, find out a bunch of information about them*

*Tap a button, get a ride*

*Come to one place, get good-looking, inexpensive furniture, for your entire home*

The format has a pattern: "You do X and Y happens", and simplifying this description
to a straightforward input and desirable output makes the product easy to understand,
recall and talk about. 

This works particularly well for tech products because the input-output pattern is
a fundamental property of how software works. In the case that your product has more
than one feature, this exercise is great for identifying which core feature of
your product should receive the most focus and attention.

Of course, once people are interested, you can take your time to dazzle them with the rest of your features, so don't worry about not being able to communicate 'why' your product is good. That can come later.

### Step 2 - What problems does it solve?

Now that you are able to describe your product, we have to describe why it exists
(namely, that people have problems that they need this product to solve).

Is there a structured way to build up a body of knowledge and expertise that can convince investors and customers that you understand their unique problems? Thankfully,
the answer is yes.

As a baseline, we build up the foundations by examining how this problem relates
to you personally. You need to be able to articulate a story about how this problem has affected you personally. Articulating the story helps to create a picture about the current processes that generate this problem, and also to clearly identify where the pain points are, and to show how your solution tackles some/all of the problems that are created. 

If the problem hasn't affected you personally, then a good substitute is to be able to narrate how the problem has affected the target user, and why witnessing this specific issue has led you to want to spend time and energy solving it.

Once you have this story, run a sense check to verify that others have this problem as well.

The next layer comes with domain expertise. Ideally, you will have industry experience in this domain. Having industry experience will give you a huge boost to your credibility factor, because you will be able to understand and explain a) existing approaches to solving this problem, and b) why these approaches are not satisfactory. Finally, industry experience also means that you will probably have to work less to build up your network in this area, which is always a positive thing.

That said, it is not the end of the world if you don't have industry experience, you just have to be prepared to do extra due diligence work to get yourself up to a similar level.

Finally, we can refine this knowledge by clustering customers into different segments and build on the foundations discussed earlier by creating a new storyboard of how your top customer segment will hear about you, how they will use the product, and how they will eventually buy at the end of their evaluation period.

### Step 3 - The MVP and the first few users

After you are able to describe your product, as well as the problems that it solves,
we have to figure out your Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

There are many theories about how you should build your MVP, and what you should
include as your MVP. In the context of the AIAP startup program, we take the same
position as Y-combinator:

1. Minimum means that you need to pare down the list of features that you are going
to build to the absolute minimum needed to solve the problem that has been identified.

2. Viable means that it has to work. It cannot be a series of disconnected features.

3. Product means that it needs to be ready to be used by users, not just developers. The final test of whether an MVP is done is when you can go to someone, explain what
the product does in one sentence, explain the problem that the product is meant to solve, and put the product into the user's hands for a test run.

**This section is important because the creation of the MVP is the core the AIAP Startup Program. This is what your team is expected to produce at the end of 7 months.**

A few final words on users to close off this section: At the end of 7 months (or earlier), we want to be able to put your product into the hands of users. 

Who will these users be at the 7 month mark? The AISG startup team will put you in touch with corporates, organizations and government agencies to beta test your product via our network and outreach programs to local online communities - assuming you have created a B2B product. 

If you have created a B2C product, then we will expose your product to the online communities in shareAI and our outreach and education programs such as AI4I and AI4E, alongside your own efforts to test your product with your friends, co-workers and niche communities that you are (hopefully already) a part of.

### What NOT to do - a checklist

Lastly, just to make absolutely sure, here is a list of things **not** to do.

1. Don't build your full product in secret (someone might just launch the same thing before you and steal your first mover advantage).

2. Don't just wait for users to show up.

3. Don't buy users (sticky growth > viral growth > paid ads).

4. Don't give up!

## In the first ten weeks, we will cover in this companion guide and in follow up events

1. Elements of [Y Combinator's Stanford CS183b: How to Start a Startup lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11qn6zM2Y3bMZdChxEqHKaCaKUjwItGL "Y Combinator's Stanford CS183b: How to Start a Startup lecture series") that we find to be very good advice for idea generation, market analysis, team selection and determining your level of readiness.

2. The AISG Framework to planning out your MVP.

3. How to the pitch (to the internal committee).

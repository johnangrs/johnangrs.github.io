## In the first six weeks, we will cover

1. Elements of [Y Combinator's Stanford CS183b: How to Start a Startup lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11qn6zM2Y3bMZdChxEqHKaCaKUjwItGL "Y Combinator's Stanford CS183b: How to Start a Startup lecture series") that we find to be very good advice for idea generation, market analysis, team selection and determining your level of readiness.

2. An Ideation Discovery Session to develop and share your ideas in a more efficient, structured manner.

3. The AISG Framework to planning out your MVP.

4. How to the pitch (to the internal committee).
